# Hospitality Domain Data Analysis Dashboard

This project showcases my expertise in data analysis and visualization using Power BI, focusing on dissecting and visualizing data from the hospitality domain. Leveraging five CSV files containing meta-information and raw data related to hotels, bookings, and room categories, this project involves several stages of data cleaning, transformation, and analysis to derive actionable insights.

## Project Objectives:

The primary objectives of this project were to:

1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**:
   - Utilize Power Query in Power BI to clean and transform raw data from CSV files, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
   - Address issues such as column renaming, data type conversion, and removal of redundant columns.

2. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Develop an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard in Power BI to present key metrics and insights derived from the data.
   - Incorporate interactive features and filters to allow users to explore data dynamically.

3. **Key Metrics Analysis**:
   - Analyze various metrics and KPIs including revenue, occupancy rate, average daily rate (ADR), revenue per available room (RevPAR), and more.
   - Calculate Week-on-Week (WoW) change percentages for revenue, occupancy, ADR, RevPAR, realization, and Daily Sellable Room Nights (DSRN) to track performance trends over time.

4. **Visualizations and Insights**:
   - Visualized revenue realization and ADR by platform to compare booking channels' performance.
   - Presented trend analysis charts for revenue, occupancy, ADR, RevPAR, realization, and DSRN.
   - Provided a breakdown of revenue by hotel category and dynamic filtering options for city, room class, month-year, and week number.

## Dashboard Highlights:

- **Revenue Realization and ADR by Platform**: Visual representations of revenue realization percentage and ADR across different booking platforms, enabling comparison and analysis.
  
- **Trend Analysis by Key Metrics**: Trend charts displaying the week-on-week change percentages for revenue, occupancy, ADR, RevPAR, realization, and DSRN, facilitating trend identification and forecasting.

- **Revenue Breakdown by Category**: Pie chart illustrating the percentage distribution of revenue across different hotel categories (Luxury, Business), providing insights into revenue sources.

- **Dynamic Filters**: Filter options by city, room class, month-year, and week number, allowing users to drill down into specific data subsets and customize their analysis.
